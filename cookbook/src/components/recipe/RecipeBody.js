                    Recipe description goes here so I'm just gonna write a bunch of stuff
                    and yeah hopefully it takes up a lot of space cuz ipsum lorem is too big to justify using I think but then again maybe
                    not so who knows I'll just talk about my salmon that I pan fry for 6 minutes one side and then 3ish minutes the other
                    side which I then season both sides with lemon pepper and cajun peppers(spices? idk).
